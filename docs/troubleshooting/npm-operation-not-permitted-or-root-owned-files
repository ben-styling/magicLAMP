# npm troubleshooting

A version of NPM caused npm to write root files, which can cause errors such as `Your cache foolder contains root-owned files` or `invalid response body while trying to fetch ${...} EPERM: operation not permitted`

See here for [here](https://npm.community/t/root-owned-files-in-cache-folder/8814) details

Running the following in the workspace will respolve these issues:

```
sudo mkdir /npm && sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /npm
npm config set prefix /npm
npm config set cache /npm
npm cache clean --force
cd ${YOUR_PROJECT}
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf package-lock.json
npm install
```

Please note, installing wsl mitigates a lot of these permission errors on Windows.
